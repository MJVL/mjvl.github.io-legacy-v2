title: About
---

I'm a high school senior passionate about computer science and cyber security. In August I'll be an undergrad majoring in Computing Security at the Rochester Institute of Technology. In my free time I intern, tutor peers, lead our school's ACM chapter with my fellow directors, learn new programming languages, and participate in various other clubs and activities.
